Mseto _(Swahili word for mixture/hybrid)_ is a Swahili word puzzle game.
<br>
The goal of the game is to match all the letters to form combinations of Swahili words.
<br>

## Difference between ng and ng'

Along with only having only 24 letters (the letters Q and X don't exist) in its alphabet, Swahili also uses the apostrophe to spell certain words. It only comes after the letters _ng_ and therefore, the game treats _ng'_ as two characters instead of 3.
